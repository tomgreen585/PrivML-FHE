# Sixth Meeting - 05/05

## Outline

- Presented baseline implementation of FHE+ML that used concrete.ml FHE library and sklearn LogisticRegression algorithm
- Discussed evaluation of the model that were collected which consisted of accuracy, time-to-train, etc.
- Evaluated what this would mean for the project going forward and what that meant for FHE's current use in real-world systems
- Highlighted the further areas I wanted to look into to improve the model

## Things to do before next meeting

- Continue looking into concrete.ml library as well as other FHE libraries that are open-source, which would then be used to compare/contrast on what methodology I could take for the final model.
- Complete background research to get full/comprehensive understanding of what systems need to be present for the FHE to be successful
- Start on the preliminary report with first draft done in the 19/05 - 23/05 week
