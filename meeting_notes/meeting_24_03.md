# Second Meeting - 24/03

## Outline

- Meeting was to discuss the current progress performed on the project proposal that was due in 5 days (28/03)
- Highlighted that this project would focus on the feasibility of implementing a FHE machine learning model and not necessarily coming up with a full robust final solution.
- Discussed the problem statement which was that:

1. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a new idea and there is not a lot of information online
1. Complexity contraints that align with implementing and developing a solution
1. FHE is a solution to most of the privacy concerns that exist in real-world cases
1. This project would look into how it would solve this as well as implementing this solution

- Discussed machine learning models that I would test/use when developing the implementation and decided that I would take a iterative approach - test multiple ML models
- Discussed sacrifing security fundamentals and complexity (e.g. key size) which would obviously draw back to the feasibility question.

## Things to do before next meeting

- Finish off proposal and other submissions for 28/03
- Start background research and look into developing a solution.
