# Tenth Meeting - 17/07

## Outline

- Went over Tenseal implementation of FHE workflow with CNN ML model.
- Analysed non-FHE-encrypted and FHE-encrypted training workflows of ML model. Understand how data is parsed as tensors, and evaluated through weights. Comparison and differences between encrypted/non-encrypted workflows and what needs to be adjusted.
- Discussed metrics from the model training (including; time, encryption strength, ML parameters) and how this can be improved.
- Discussed how final object will be interpreted and the steps needed to get there.
- Discussed current feedback from preliminary report. Will re go over this in next meeting.

## Things to do before next meeting

- Establish better documentation for evaluation outputs
- Plan design for server(ML and FHE) and client(ML) ends of the project
- Start implementing
