ABSTRACT-BEGIN:
This project explores the feasibility of implementing a privacy-preserving machine learning (ML) model using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). As data security becomes increasingly critical across business sectors, solutions that enable computation on encrypted data, without revealing raw inputs, are gaining importance. This project proposes FHE as a solution to this, as a cryptographic method that allows operations to be performed directly on encrypted data, offering strong privacy guarantees. This project will use open-source libraries to train and evaluate basic ML models entirely on encrypted inputs, assessing performance, accuracy, and usability compared to an unencrypted baseline. While a working prototype and user interface may be developed to demonstrate real-world applications, the primary goal is to evaluate whether FHE is a viable and practical  solution for secure ML under current technological constraints.
