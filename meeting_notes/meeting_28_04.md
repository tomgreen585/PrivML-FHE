# Fifth Meeting - 28/04

## Outline

- Discussed existing libraries, limitations of existing implementations, approach from baseline -> producible.
- Discussed trade-off and benefits if coding in Python and C++, for both FHE and ML implementations.
- If coding in Python, use Types -> allow for easy convert to different languages, etc.
- Look into Benchmarkâ€™s associated with FHE.
- Talked about set evaluation metrics briefly, this would change throughout when different functionality is added.

## Things to do before next meeting

- Upload 489 research doc to google docs for Arman to read over work done so far.
- Explore libraries to create a baseline model for next meeting.
