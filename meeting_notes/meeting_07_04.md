# Fourth Meeting - 07/04

## Outline

- Discussed research that had been done over previous week
- Outline what makes homomorphic encryption 'fully' homomorphic encryption -> bootstrapping
- Highlighted bootstrapping is what makes FHE computationally expensive and possible solutions to either improve this process or replace this entirely
- Looked into producing a FHE+ML solution where ML would replace the bootstrapping process which would improve computation time + efficiency
- Discussed Leveled FHE
- Highlighted that should look at feasibility solutions that are standard FHE, leveled FHE, and ML FHE
- Discussed that evaluation of practical and technical solutions are needed -> evaluate high-level, local processes, whether they are deployed in a API, etc.

## Things to do before next meeting

- Set up baseline ("Hello World") to evaluate when looking at solutions
- Perform further research, keep track of findings, document background research and processes/solutions to look-into/implement.
