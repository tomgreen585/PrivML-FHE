# Eleventh Meeting - 24/07

## Outline

- Discussed provided feedback from other markers regarding the preliminary report.
- Discussed how this project contributes to sustainability elements regarding privacy.
- Discussed CKKS, BGV, BFV and other schemes and how they provide FHE components, specifically the bootstrapping process.
- Discussed ML model implementation and what ML model the project will have.
- Discussion around CNN implementation and the development of a Face Detection model, which would do whatever augmentation to the image that the user wants. Essentially a AI agent, based on a regression CNN model.
- Discussed how OS, RAM, GPU etc. and how they should be documented when performing evaluation as well as in the final report.

## Things to do before next meeting

- Start implementing ML pipeline. Establishing this now, means that when implementing FHE pipeline and client side, this will be able to just plug into the ML model.
- Maybe look into federated learning and how that might work if creating server and client later down the line.
