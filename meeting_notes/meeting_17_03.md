# First Meeting - 17/03

## Outline

- Went in with questions: regarding the project, what is expected, and what is the purpose of the project. Questions included:

1. What kind of deliverable would you like at the end of the project -> e.g. IDEA demonstration of model working, fully built web-app where models can be trained or have pre-trained models showing FHE encryption.
1. Are there any metrics you expect to see (e.g. execution time, accuracy, encryption overhead)?
1. To what extent should I dive into the underlying cryptographic princples of FHE or should I focus on a practical implementation.
1. Is there an expectation to discuss real-world deployment considerations.

- Discussed final output/deliverable of this project -> might have to include a software object to have for presentation purposes (since graders would be software background instead of cybr)
- Discussed FHE as its currently implemented and how I could approach what is currently out there (e.g. open-source, libraries)
- Discussed different machine learning architecutre to use, e.g. KNN, Logistic regression.
- Purpose was that this project would progress after this year, more looking into the practicality of FHE and if its a viable solution for real-world technologies.

## Things to do before next meeting

- Do further background research on FHE and where we could take this.
- Start working on proposal.
